# Hello, I am Daniel Dobbs
I began my career in retail, where I developed strong teamwork skills and frequently used technology such as mobile scanners and phones. During this time, I often found myself thinking about how I could improve the user interface and overall technology to better suit the needs of retail workers.

In my free time, I worked on personal projects, such as modding games and setting up a Minecraft server for my friends. While these projects didnâ€™t directly teach me how to code, they introduced me to server management and working with JSON, sparking my interest in software development.

To deepen my understanding, I pursued a degree in computer science. During college, I learned the importance of Agile and Scrum methodologies, particularly the role of stakeholders in shaping product development. Reflecting on my retail experience, I realized that as a retail worker, I was essentially a stakeholder who could have provided valuable feedback to improve the product experience.

I also gained experience in server-client development, which allowed me to create my own mods/servers for games I enjoyed. Alongside learning Java, C++, and Python in college, I taught myself C# to expand my skillset.

I am passionate about building applications that enhance user experiences, and I continuously explore novel technologies to stay up-to-date with the latest trends. For instance, I recently collaborated with a friend to build a personal game using the Godot engine, which further fueled my interest in game design and indie development.

I am currently seeking opportunities that allow me to apply my skills and continue growing as a software developer.
